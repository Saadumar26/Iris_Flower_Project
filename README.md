Iris Flower Project
Welcome to the Iris Flower Project! This project focuses on solving a classification problem using various machine learning supervised models, primarily Logistic Regression, and Cross-Validation techniques.

Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the species of iris flowers based on their characteristics such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we aim to accurately classify the iris flowers into their respective species.

Features
Utilizes logistic regression and cross-validation for classification.
Input features include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Output classes consist of different species of iris flowers.
